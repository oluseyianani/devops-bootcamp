2. [Project 2: Setup Multiple Static Websites on a Single Server Using Nginx Virtual Hosts](projects/project-2.md)
3. [Project 3: Setup Load Balancing for Static Websites Using Nginx](projects/project-3.md)
4. [Project 4: Setup WordPress Website Using LAMP Stack](projects/project-4.md)

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find detailed documentation for each of the projects listed above. Each project is aimed at developing specific skills and understanding key concepts within web development, server management, and cloud computing.

- **Project 1:** In the first project, I set up a static website using Nginx, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance. This project covers everything from registering a domain to securing the site with SSL/TLS certificates.
- **Project 2:** In the second project, I explored how to host multiple static websites on a single server using Nginx Virtual Hosts. This included setting up subdomains, configuring virtual hosts, and securing the sites with SSL certificates using Certbot.
- **Project 3:** In the third project, I delved into load balancing with Nginx, looking into how to distribute incoming web traffic across multiple servers to enhance site reliability and performance. It involves setting up a Nginx as a load balancer, configuring DNS, and securing connections with SSL/TLS.
- **Project 4:** For the fourth project, I set up a WordPress website using a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), covering the process from server setup to final website configuration, including securing the site with SSL certificates and WordPress customization.

Each project link will take you to a dedicated markdown file where you can explore the project's documentation in depth. Feel free to explore, and if you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out!
