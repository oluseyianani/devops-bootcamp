## Overview

In this repository, you'll find detailed documentation for each of the projects listed above. Each project is aimed at developing specific skills and understanding key concepts within web development, server management, and cloud computing.

- **Project 1:** In the first project, I set up a static website using Nginx, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance. This project covers everything from registering a domain to securing the site with SSL/TLS certificates.
- **Project 2:** In the second project, I explored how to host multiple static websites on a single server using Nginx Virtual Hosts. This included setting up subdomains, configuring virtual hosts, and securing the sites with SSL certificates using Certbot.
- **Project 3:** In the third project, I delved into load balancing with Nginx, looking into how to distribute incoming web traffic across multiple servers to enhance site reliability and performance. It involves setting up a Nginx as a load balancer, configuring DNS, and securing connections with SSL/TLS.
- **Project 4:** For the fourth project, I set up a WordPress website using a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), covering the process from server setup to final website configuration, including securing the site with SSL certificates and WordPress customization.
- **Project 5:** In the fifth project, I implemented service discovery using Nginx and Consul. This project focused on setting up Consul for dynamic service registration and discovery, configuring Nginx as a load balancer that automatically updates its backend servers based on Consul's service registry, and validating the dynamic scaling and health checks in a microservices environment.
- **Project 6:** In the sixth project, I built a Flask API to demonstrate how APIs work, using Python's Flask framework. This project covers setting up a basic API to manage user data, implementing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), and testing the API using Postman. Additionally, the project includes creating a simple frontend using HTML and CSS, as well as deploying the API in a virtual environment.
- **Project 7:** In the seventh project, I designed and deployed an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to create an isolated network environment for hosting services. This project involved setting up subnets across multiple availability zones, creating route tables, attaching an Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway, and configuring network ACLs for security. The project also covers testing the VPC topology and verifying connectivity between private and public subnets.
- **Project 8:** In the eighth project, I automated the creation of AWS infrastructure using **Terraform**
